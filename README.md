•	Project Prologue:

This project is a blockchain-based cryptocurrency platform that allows secure transactions, coin mining, and user interaction through a dynamic web interface.


•	Project Layout: 

This platform includes a Python-powered backend for blockchain functionality, a MySQL database for data management, and a user-friendly front end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. User challenges, with project deployment on a local host setup, enhance blockchain mining.

In this project, the Fetch API enables real-time data exchange between the front end and back end for seamless transactions, balance updates, and mining.
